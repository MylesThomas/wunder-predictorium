# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here are answers to some common questions. This list will be updated during the competition.

## Competition mechanics

### What is the goal of this competition?

Your goal is to predict future market indicators (t0, t1) from a sequence of previous market states. It's a sequence modeling task.

### What's the evaluation metric?

We use the **Weighted Pearson Correlation Coefficient**, averaged across the two target variables. This metric weights predictions by the magnitude of the target value (larger moves matter more) and clips predictions to the range `[-6, 6]`. Check `utils.weighted_pearson_correlation` for details. A higher score is better.

### Can I work in a team?

Yes, you can participate as an individual or as part of a team. Currently there's no way to team-up in the interface.

### How many submissions can I make per day?

You can make up to **10 submissions per day**.

## Data questions

### Can I use external data?

No. All solutions must be trained using only the provided `train.parquet` and `valid.parquet` datasets.

### Can I use pre-trained models?

Yes, you may use open-source pre-trained models, provided they are publicly available and do not contain external market data.

### Why are the features anonymized?

The features are anonymized to focus the competition on the modeling task itself, rather than on domain-specific feature engineering.

### How should I create a validation set?

We provide a `valid.parquet` file for convenience. However, since the sequences in the data are independent and shuffled, we believe that random splitting by `seq_ix` is likely a valid and robust approach. You are free to merge the datasets and create your own splits (e.g., K-Fold).

## Technical questions

### What are the compute resources for the submission environment?

Your code will run in a Linux container with:

- 1 CPU core
- 16 GB of RAM
- No GPU — CPU inference only
- A 90-minute time limit for the entire test set

### What is the expected size of the test datasets?

Both the public and private test sets have a size similar to the validation dataset, containing approximately **1,500 sequences** each.

### Why is there no GPU?

In many real-world, high-frequency trading environments, inference must happen very quickly on CPU-only hardware. We've designed the competition environment to reflect these realistic constraints.

### What Python libraries are available?

You can expect standard libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `torch`, `onnxruntime` and `tensorflow`.

### Does my code need to be deterministic?

Yes. Your code should produce the same output when run twice on the same data. Remember to set your random seeds.

### My solution has multiple files. How do I submit it?

You can include multiple files in your `.zip` submission (model weights, helper scripts, etc.). Just make sure your main `solution.py` file is at the root of the archive.
