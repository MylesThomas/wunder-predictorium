# Competition Rules

Welcome to the new Wunder Challenge! We're excited to see what you'll build. Here are the rules to ensure a fair and fun competition for everyone.

## The basics

- **Who can join**: The competition is open to everyone, worldwide. You can participate as an individual or as part of a team.
- **How you're scored**: We use two leaderboards. The Public Leaderboard provides feedback on a sample of the test data. The Private Leaderboard, used at the end, determines the final winners on a separate, hidden dataset.
- **What you submit**: This is a code competition. You'll upload your inference code as a `.zip` file.

## Fair play

- **No external data**: Your solution must only use the training data we provide.
- **Pre-trained models are allowed**: You may use open-source pre-trained models, provided they are publicly available and do not contain external market data.
- **Isolated environment**: Your code will run in an isolated Linux container with no internet access.
- **Sharing**: Please don't share your code, models, or detailed strategies publicly before the competition is over. Discussing general ideas is great, but sharing complete solutions isn't fair to others. Private sharing between participants is also not allowed.
- **Submissions**: You can make up to **10 submissions per day**.
- **Single accounts**: One account per team/person. We won't see the #1 participant to take all the winning ranks.
- **No messing with the infra**: We respect out-of-the box thinking and the hacker way very much. If you crack our scoring system, leak the data or such — you'll have our regards, but you'll also be disqualified.

**Violation of the rules will lead to disqualification.**

## Leaderboard and tie-breaking

- **Final ranking**: Your final position will be determined solely by your score on the Private Leaderboard. Close to the end of the competition you will be asked to choose some of your previously submitted and scored solutions to be re-scored on the Final Dataset.
- **Tie-breaking**: If two participants have the exact same score, the participant who submitted their solution earlier will be ranked higher.
