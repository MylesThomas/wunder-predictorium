# Submission Guide

This page covers the technical requirements for your submission, including the code format, how to package your files, and the resource limits.

## What to submit

This is a code competition. You'll submit a `.zip` file containing all the code and artifacts needed to generate predictions.

The key requirements are:

- The zip file must contain a `solution.py` file at its root.
- Your `solution.py` must define a class named `PredictionModel`.
- This class must have a `predict(self, data_point)` method.

## The PredictionModel class

Here's the required structure for your `PredictionModel` class:

```python
import numpy as np
from utils import DataPoint

class PredictionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your model, load weights, etc.
        pass

    def predict(self, data_point: DataPoint) -> np.ndarray | None:
        # This is where your prediction logic goes.
        if not data_point.need_prediction:
            return None

        # When a prediction is needed, return a numpy array of length 2 (for t0 and t1).
        # Replace this with your model's actual output.
        prediction = np.zeros(2)
        return prediction
```

Your `predict` method will receive a `DataPoint` object with the current market state. Your code should return `None` if `need_prediction` is False, and a NumPy array of shape `(2,)` otherwise.

The `DataPoint` object comes from the provided `utils.py` file and has the following attributes:

- `seq_ix: int`: The ID for the current sequence.
- `step_in_seq: int`: The step number within the sequence.
- `need_prediction: bool`: Whether a prediction is required for this point.
- `state: np.ndarray`: The current market state vector (containing p0..p9, v0..v9, dp0..1, dv0..1).

> **Important**: Remember to handle the model's internal state. When you encounter a new sequence (a new `seq_ix`), you must reset any recurrent state.

## Including other files

Most solutions will need more than just `solution.py`. You can include other files in your zip archive, such as:

- Model weights (e.g., `.pt`, `.h5`, `.onnx` files).
- Helper Python modules (`.py` files).
- Configuration files (e.g., `.json`, `.yaml`).
- Small data files.

Just make sure `solution.py` is at the root of the archive.

## How to package your solution

You need to package all your files into a single `.zip` archive.

### macOS/Linux

```bash
# cd into the directory that contains your solution files
zip -r ../submission.zip .
```

This creates `submission.zip` in the parent directory, containing everything from your current folder.

### Windows

```bash
# Use PowerShell
Compress-Archive -Path * -DestinationPath ..\submission.zip
```

## Resource and time limits

Your submitted code will run in an isolated environment with the following constraints:

- **CPU**: 1 vCPU core
- **No GPU**
- **RAM**: 16 GB
- **Storage**: Local SSD
- **Time limit**: Your code must finish generating predictions for the entire test set in **90 minutes or less**.
- **No internet access**: The execution environment is offline.

## How submissions are scored

When you submit a solution, a scoring Docker container is deployed. The container image is based on `python:3.11-slim-bookworm`.

The environment variables used by some ML libraries are configured to prevent them from attempting to access the network.

Below is part of the Dockerfile. You might want to use it locally for debug purposes:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm

RUN apt-get update && apt-get full-upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y curl libgomp1 p7zip-full build-essential && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --upgrade pip \
 && python -m pip install --prefer-binary --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu -r /tmp/requirements.txt \
 && python -m pip install orbax-checkpoint \
 && python -m pip check && pip cache purge

# Keep heavy libs strictly offline at runtime 
ENV HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 \
    TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1 \
    HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 \
    WANDB_DISABLED=1 MLFLOW_ENABLE_SYSTEM_METRICS_LOGGING=false \
# Redirect all caches into /app
    HOME=/app \
    XDG_CACHE_HOME=/app/.cache \
    MPLCONFIGDIR=/app/.matplotlib \
    TORCH_HOME=/app/.cache/torch \
    HF_HOME=/app/.cache/huggingface \
    TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=/app/.cache/huggingface/transformers \
    HF_DATASETS_CACHE=/app/.cache/huggingface/datasets \
    NUMBA_CACHE_DIR=/app/.cache/numba
```

> **Note**: If you need any package added to the scorer docker image, please drop us a line in [Discord](https://predictorium.wundernn.io/discord) or via the [get help](https://predictorium.wundernn.io/docs/get_help) page.

## Submit your package

Once you have your `submission.zip` ready:
